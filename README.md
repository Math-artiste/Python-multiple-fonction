# Python-multiple-tools
A repository which contains many .py file that can be usefull at any moments (from clcoding.com/https://www.youtube.com/c/PythonCoding)

Hello, for everybody who are reading this i'm happy that you are interested for this repository.
I create this repository to have my python files everywhere and i did not create all codes, 
i copy them from the python coding youtube account because he's doing the 365 day coding challenge and i learned many things thanks to his youtube account 
so i hope all this files will maybe help you or maybe someone will find great ways to make them better (i'm a beginner in python).
Finally i hope that you will take fun with this repository.

Take care about the file "pdf_password_protection" because it did not decrypt the file encrypted (i'm searching why).
